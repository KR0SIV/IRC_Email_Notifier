IRC to email/SMS notifier

This is pretty basic/simple to setup.
You need the 'gmail' gem installed.



"gem install gmail"

Then just edit the script and replace the irc and email detaials (you'll see comments on it).
If you want to use SMS simply google 'email to sms gateway' they are free and let you email a phone number.
